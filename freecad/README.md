# FreeCAD 0.18.5
a free and opensource multiplatform 3D parametric modeler. 

FreeCAD on Raspberry Pi has always been hit or miss, really ; It just loads up and crashes. I have recompiled the latest version of FreeCAD (0.18.5), into a .deb file for the fastest possible installation. Follow the instructions below: or you can learn how to compile it at [this link](https://scruss.com/blog/2020/02/16/freecad-on-raspberry-pi-4/)

### 32bit Installation
